Linear Regression Implementation in Julia &amp; Python 

As a part of Comparing Julia with Python, I have implemented Linear Regression in Python & replicated the same steps in Julia.I have considered Cars Dataset(split into Train & Test Data files), which I will include in this repo.

The comparison is done in each of the following stages:
1)	Descriptive Stats
2)	Visualisation
3)	Data Pre-processing
4)	Modelling
