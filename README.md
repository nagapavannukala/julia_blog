Problem Statement:
Predict the price of Second-hand cars taking cars' attributes into consideration.

Data Summary:
The Target is "Price" column, which is dependant on regressors such as "Year"(Year of 1st purchase), "Transmission Type","Kilometres-Driven","Mileage", etc.,

As a part of Comparing Julia with Python, I have implemented Linear Regression in Python & replicated the same steps in Julia.I have considered Cars Dataset(split into Train & Test Data files), which I will include in this repo.

The comparison is done in each of the following stages:
1)	Descriptive Stats
2)	Visualisation
3)	Data Pre-processing
4)	Modelling
